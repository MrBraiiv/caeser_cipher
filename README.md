# Caesar_Cipher tool
### Understanding the tool:
In cryptography, a Caesar cipher, also known as Caesar’s cipher, the shift cipher, Caesar’s code or Caesar shift, is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example, with a left shift of 3, D would be replaced by A, E would become B, and so on. The method is named after Julius Caesar, who used it in his private correspondence.
### How the tool works:
- the tool will ask you for the sentece you want to cipher
- the tool asks you for the shift factor
- the tool will give you the ciphered sentece!
